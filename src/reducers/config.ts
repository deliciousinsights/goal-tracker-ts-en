// "System" config for the app
// ===========================
//
// By listening to redux-persist's rehydration action, we can maintain a flag
// about our app state being hydrated (or not yet), which enables our
// `RehydrationWaiter` component.
//
// We also handle notification permission management here, both for its initial
// state (the API is available and we weren't blocked yet) and later requests
// through a [generic async
// action](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-guide#async-requests-with-createasyncthunk),
// process through the middleware preconfigured by Redux Toolkit.

import { createAsyncThunk, createReducer } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
// Redux-Persist apparently doesn't export types for its constants, soâ€¦
// @ts-ignore
import { REHYDRATE } from 'redux-persist/constants'

type Config = {
  // - Should we prompt the user at all?
  canPromptForNotify: boolean
  // - Do we have permission to notify?
  canNotify: boolean
  // - Was the state hydrated by redux-persist already?
  rehydrated: boolean
}

// ---------------

// This is dispatched by the UI -see `TrackerScreen` and triggers the
// notification permission prompt.  Chromium doesn't require it be triggered
// from an interactive event, but Firefox obeys spec recommendations and does.

  // As our callback is async, any direct return of something other than a
  // promise is automatically wrapped as a fulfilled promise.

    if (bootNotificationPermission === 'denied') {
      return 'denied'
    }

    // Leveraging system-based
    // [notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/notification/Using_Web_Notifications)
    // isn't automatically allowed: the user must have granted us permission.
    // This function returns a promise to the resulting status, used following
    // the permission request action.
